/**
 * The public API testing whether a specific feature is enabled and,
 * if so, what variant should be used.
 *
 * Primary public API:
 *
 *   Feature::isEnabled('foo');
 *   Feature::variant('foo');
 *
 * For cases when we want to bucket on a user other than the currently
 * logged in user (e.g. to bucket how we treat listings by their
 * owners) this secondary API is available:
 *
 *   Feature::isEnabledFor('foo', $user);
 *   Feature::variantFor('foo', $user);
 *
 * And for case when we want to bucket on something else entirely
 * (such as a shop ID), we provide these two methods:
 *
 *   Feature::isEnabledBucketingBy('foo', $bucketingID);
 *   Feature::variantBucketingBy('foo', $bucketingID);
 *
 * In addition, in order to support Smarty templates, which can't call
 * static methods, the getInstance() method returns a singleton object
 * that can be passed to templates and which provides the same API via
 * instance methods.
